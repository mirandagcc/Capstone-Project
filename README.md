In order to login you need to put any valid email in the 'username' part and
write anything in the 'password' and it will let you in to the only user. 

For example: 
username = miranda.nichole.g@gmail.com
password = password

This ofcourse will be fixed for the final deliverable according to Pepe's requirements. 

Thanks!
